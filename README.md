# Eight Queens

The **Eight Queens** Puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.  In other words, the solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.  There are 92 different solutions.

The problem was first posed in the mid-19th century. In the modern era, it is often used as an example problem for computer programming.  While there are
many programs on the Internet that solve the problem algorithmically and recursively, there are very few puzzle games for you to actually try it yourself.

## Playing the Game
Add and remove queens on the chessboard to solve the puzzle.  To place or remove a queen from a square, click on that square.  You can only have up to eight queens on the board at any given time, and the counter shows you how many are placed.

As a hint, the chessboard squares squares turn red if you've placed a queen in a threatening position with another queen (they share the same column, row, or diagonal).

RESET BOARD is used to clear the chess board.

## Winning the Game
To win the game, you need to figure out how to place the eight queens on the chess board.  When you've found a solution to the puzzle, the squares with the eight correctly placed queens turn green and the game ends!  RESET BOARD clears the board for a new game.

## Technical Details
The code is written in Java and the application was developed using Android Studio.  The application demonstrates the use of Canvas and Paint classes for drawing on the screen, along with creating the chessboard as a custom element.

I'd love to hear from you!  Happy Gaming!
