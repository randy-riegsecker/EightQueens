# Eight Queens

The **Eight Queens** Puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.  In other words, the solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.  There are 92 different solutions.

As you play, the squares turn red if another queen is in an attack position.  To win the game, you need to figure out how to place the eight queens on the board.  To place or remove a queen from a square, click on that square.  As you play the game, if a queen is in a threating position with another queen (they share the same column, row, or diagonal, the square turns red.  When you've found a solution to the puzzle, the squares with the queens turn green and the game ends

The code is written in Java and the application was developed using Android Studio.  The application demonstrates the use of Canvas and Paint classes for drawing on the screen, along with creating the chessboard as a custom element.

Happy Gaming!
